1. Clear out SendGridEvents and remind Matt to tell Trois the Solutions can be
	found by filtering on 'Unopened'.
2. Add 48, 72, 100hr notification events
3. If a solution is re-delivered update SendGridEvents table. Maybe add a 're-sent' status
	and update all events by message_ids to be 're-sent'. If status = 're-sent'
	don't send notification.

	
	
	What I did Monday Night:
	1. Changed send grid events in prod db to 're-sent', except for ones delivered
		after white label was up and working.
	2. Unopened Notification Email is sent only to me.
	3. EmailDeliveryManager looks for message_id groups without the event of
		'open' or 're-sent'
	
	To Do: Implement the 48 72 100 hr plan.
	Also, if an email is resent, change the sg_event to 're-sent'
